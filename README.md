# 🤖 Task 1 – Rule-Based Chatbot (Java)

This is the first task for the **Artificial Intelligence Internship** at **CodSoft**.  
The goal of this project is to build a **simple chatbot** using **rule-based logic** with `if-else` statements in Java.

## 📌 Project Objective
> **Create a chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules.**  
> This helps in understanding basic conversation flow and introduces simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts using Java logic.
## 💻 Tech Stack

- Language: Java
- Tools: VS Code / Terminal
- Approach: Rule-Based (using `if-else` conditions)
 ## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open a terminal in the folder containing `ChatBot.java`
2. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
   javac ChatBot.java




# 🎮 Task 2 – Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Python)

This is the second task for the **Artificial Intelligence Internship** at **CodSoft**.

The goal is to create a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** where a human plays against an **unbeatable AI** powered by the **Minimax algorithm**. The game runs in the terminal using Python.

## 📌 Project Objective

> Build a Tic-Tac-Toe AI that uses Minimax to make the best possible move each time, ensuring the AI cannot be beaten.  
> This helps in understanding **game theory**, **decision trees**, and **AI logic for turn-based games**.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3
- Libraries: None (pure Python)
- Algorithm: Minimax (no pruning)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Open terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the file.
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe_ai.py

## 🕹️ How to Play
1.You play as X, and the AI plays as O.
2.Enter your move by selecting a number from 1 to 9 as shown below:
1 | 2 | 3
--+---+--
4 | 5 | 6
--+---+--
7 | 8 | 9
3.The game continues until there's a win or a draw.

💡 Features
✅ AI always plays optimally using Minimax
✅ Text-based UI for clarity
✅ Detects win/loss/draw
✅ Validates user input




# 🎥 Task 3 – Movie Recommendation System (Python)

This is Task 4 of the **Artificial Intelligence Internship** under **CodSoft**.

In this project, I built a simple **movie recommendation system** using a content-based filtering approach. The recommender uses movie descriptions and **cosine similarity** to suggest similar movies.

## 🎯 Objective

> Create a recommendation system that suggests similar items (movies) based on user preferences.  
> This system helps users discover related content using basic **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning** techniques.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn` (for TF-IDF & similarity)
